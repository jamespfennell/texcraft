Bad TFM file: Design size too small!
I've set it to 10 points.
Bad TFM file: Ligature step produces the nonexistent character '001.
Ligature step with nonstandard code changed to LIG
Bad TFM file: Ligature step for nonexistent character '140.
Bad TFM file: Ligature step produces the nonexistent character '203.
Ligature step with nonstandard code changed to LIG
 
Width index for character '000 is too large;
so I reset it to zero.
