# Introduction to Boxworks

Boxworks is a work-in-progress re-implementation of the typesetting engine
    inside TeX.
It is language-agnostic in the sense that it doesn't rely on the TeX language.
We envisage a future in which you can take, say, Typst source
    code and typeset it using the Boxworks engine.
