# Welcome to Texcraft


## What's in a name?

Texcraft is a contraction of TeX and craft.
The verb craft in part pays homage to Robert Nystrom's book [_Crafting Interpreters_](https://craftinginterpreters.com/),
    which is an inspiration both because of its wonderful presentation of the process of writing language a parser and
    because the book itself is so beautifully typeset.
(Unfortunately the methods of the book do not directly apply to TeX becaues TeX is not context free
    and has dynamic lexing rules, among other problems.)
We hope Texcraft will eventually enable people to craft their own TeX distributions.

The name Texcraft is written using the letter casing rule for proper nouns shared by most langauges that use a Roman alphabet:
    the first letter is in uppercase, and the remaining letters are in lowercase.
To quote [Robert Bringhurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Typographic_Style), 
    "an increasing number of persons and institutions, from archy and mehitabel,
    to PostScript and TrueType, come to the typographer in search of special treatment
    \[...\] Logotypes and logograms push typography in the direction of heiroglyphics, which
    tend to be looked at rather than read."
