    <h1>Texcraft</h1>

    <p>
        Texcraft is a project to create a new, modern implementation of TeX.
        The name is a portmanteau of <b>TeX</b> and O<b>xide</b>,
        the latter referencing the programming language used in the project, Rust.
        The project is currently in a very early prototyping/proof-of-concept phase.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="">GitHub repository</a></li>
        <li>Texcraft architecture document</li>
        <li><a href="/rustdoc/texcraft/">Documentation generated from the Rust code</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project description</h2>
    <p>
        Texcraft is not a specific distribution of TeX.
        Instead, it is directly inspired by
        <a title="'After the design of LLVM IR, the next most important aspect of LLVM
is that it is designed as a set of libraries, rather than as a monolithic command line compiler like GCC...'"
           href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/llvm.html" class="tooltip">LLVM</a>
        and is an attempt to implement TeX as a collection of loosely coupled libraries.
        A library in Texcraft might be:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A new pagination algorithm</li>
        <li>Handling for a particular font format.</li>
        <li>
            Implementations of a subset of TeX primitives, like the various <span class="code">\def</span> commands.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These components can then be combined in a modular way to create a specific TeX distribution,
        just like pieces of LLVM can be combined to create a specific compiler.
        Parts of Texcraft could also be used to create other software exposing some limited TeX functionality
        - for example, a web service that validates TeX formulas using the Texcraft formula parser.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a new approach to implementing TeX.
        The existing distributions all have separate monolithic codebases that are hard to reuse.
        There are many benefits to an LLVM-style approach:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It will be significantly easier to create new TeX distributions or to
            extend existing ones with new features; for example, grid based typesetting.
            While Texcraft sounds like a pure software project,
            one of the main motivations is facilitating innovation on the typesetting side.
        </li>
        <li>Distributions can share code and features easily.</li>
        <li>Texcraft components can be used in other contexts too, not just in TeX compilers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        While a modular architecture is key to these goals,
        we also think that Texcraft being written in a modern programming language and style will help significantly, too.
    </p>

    <p>
        The main goal of Texcraft is make TeX implementation development easier,
        but there is also an opportunity here to fix common UX issues:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Documents will be automatically recompiled if the internal references change,
            and this will extend to BibTeX.
        </li>
        <li>
            Errors will have clearer messages,
            will not trap users in confusing interactive prompts,
            and in many cases will auto-suggest a solution:
            <ul>

                <li class="code">undefined control sequence \Uppercase: did you mean \uppercase?</li>
                <li class="code">
                    â€œCould not find chap_1.tex.tex; did you mean to write \input{chap_1} instead of
                    \input{chap_1.tex}?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There are some interesting stretch goals in this area, for example creating a package manager for automatically
        downloading and managing CTAN packages for individual TeX projects.
